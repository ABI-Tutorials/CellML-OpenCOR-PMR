Future developments
===================

Both CellML and OpenCOR are continuing to be developed. These notes will
be updated to reflect new features of both. The next release of OpenCOR
(0.5) will include

-  the SED-ML API which means that all the variables controlling the
   simulation and its output can be specified in a file for that
   simulation

-  the BioSignalML API which will allow experimental data to be read
   into OpenCOR in a standardised way

-  colour plots, to better distinguish overlapping traces in the output
   windows

Priorities for later releases of OpenCOR include the incorporation of
GIT into OpenCOR to enable the upload of models to PMR, graphical
rendering of the model structure (using SVG), model building templates,
such as templates for creating Markov models, tools for parameter
estimation and tools for analysing model outputs.

The next release of CellML (1.2) will include the ability to specify a
probability distribution for a parameter value. Together with SED-ML,
this will allow OpenCOR to generate error bounds on the solutions,
corresponding to the specified parameter uncertainty.

These notes are currently being extended to include

-  a discussion of system identification and parameter estimation

-  more extensive discussion of membrane protein models

-  CellML modules for signal transduction pathways
